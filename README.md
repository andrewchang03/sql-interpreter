# Database Operations in OCaml

The final project for Cornell University's CS 3110: Data Structures and 
Functional Programming course taught in OCaml.

We build a database management system that emulates key SQL queries. A custom
REPL for the system is built to test queries and handle file I/O in CSV. Please
visit [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to see how to configure OCaml environment
on your local machine to test this project.
